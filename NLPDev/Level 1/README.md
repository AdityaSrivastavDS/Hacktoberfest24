# Level 1 - Building a Chat Interface with an LLM

## Task Overview

In this task, you are required to create and run a simple chat interface powered by a Large Language Model (LLM). The interface should allow users to interact with the LLM in a conversational format. You can run this locally or on a platform such as Google Colab. Your submission should include images of the conversation or a link to the Colab notebook, along with proper documentation of the process.

### Objective

- Build a basic chat interface that allows interaction with an LLM.
- Capture the conversation with the LLM and provide documentation on how the interface was developed.
- Provide a link to the Colab notebook or the chat interface code.

### Steps to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repo**

   - Fork the repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repo**

   - Clone the forked repository to your local environment:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/Hacktoberfest_2024
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Correct Directory**

   - Navigate to the Level 1 directory where you will submit your task:

   ```bash
   cd Hacktoberfest24/NLPDev/Level 1/
   ```

4. **Create a Folder with Your Username**

   - Create a new folder named after your GitHub username:

   ```bash
   mkdir <your_username>
   ```

5. **Create and Test the Chat Interface**

   - Set up a chat interface that interacts with an LLM. You can do this:
     - **Locally**: Using any framework or tools of your choice (e.g., Ollama, Oogabooga).
     - **Google Colab**: Set up the interface in a Colab notebook.
   - Test the interface by conducting a conversation with the LLM.

6. **Capture the Conversation**

   - Take screenshots of the chat conversation, or save the output logs.
   - If using Google Colab, save the Colab notebook (`.ipynb` file).

7. **Document the Process**

   - In a `.txt` or `.md` file, document:
     - **How the Interface Was Built**: Provide a step-by-step explanation.
     - **Frameworks/Tools Used**: List the tools, libraries, or frameworks you used.
     - **How to Run the Interface**: If running locally, give instructions on how to set it up.

8. **Submit Screenshots or Notebook**

   - Add screenshots of the conversation and the chat interface, or include a link to the Colab notebook.
   - Save the notebook (`.ipynb` file) if applicable.

   Example:

   ```bash
   cp <your_screenshots>.png <your_username>/
   cp <your_notebook>.ipynb <your_username>/
   cp README.md <your_username>/
   ```

9. **Add and Commit Your Changes**

   - Stage your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

   - Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Added Level 1 Chat Interface task by <your_username>"
   ```

10. **Push Your Changes and Open a Pull Request**

    - Push your changes to your forked repository:

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

    - Open a Pull Request to submit your work for review.
